# Arduino WiFi SuperCollider sensors
 
 Resources and tutorials for streaming sensor data over WiFi.
 
 This repository contains supporting materials for presenting how to stream sensor data using OSC on a wireless network using a microcontroller. It is not meant to be a finished tutorial, but rather a set of tools and waypoints for building your own system.
 
 See [wiki](https://github.com/dyfer/arduino-wifi-supercollider-sensors/wiki) pages for more details.
 
I prepared these materials for a guest workhop in the course "Special Topics in Digital Arts and Experimental Media
Body Sound Interface" taught by [Afroditi Psarra](https://dxarts.washington.edu/people/afroditi-psarra) at [DXARTS](https://dxarts.washington.edu) in Summer 2019.
