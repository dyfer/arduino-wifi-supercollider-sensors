# Arduino WiFi SuperCollider sensors
 
 Resources and tutorials for streaming sensor data over WiFi.
 
 This repository contains supporting materials for presenting how to stream sensor data using OSC on a wireless network using a microcontroller. It is not meant to be a finished tutorial, but rather a set of tools and waypoints for building your own system.
 
 See wiki pages for more details.
